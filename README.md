When fire is detected on the frame, a high signal is sent serially to COM3 using pythonâ€™s pyserial library,This in turn will cause an alarm to go off.
Made for the purpose of detection of electrical fire, if fire/Smoke/Spark is detected in 20(tangible) frames in a row, servometer rotates by 180 degree causing the MCB to trip.
